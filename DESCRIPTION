Description: Create and customize interactive collapsible 'D3' trees using the 'D3'
    JavaScript library and the 'htmlwidgets' package. These trees can be used
    directly from the R console, from 'RStudio', in Shiny apps and R Markdown documents.
    When in Shiny the tree layout is observed by the server and can be used as a reactive filter
    of structured data.
